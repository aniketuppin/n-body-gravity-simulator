# N-body Gravity Simulator:
1) This project aims to compute and display the gravitational interaction between 'n' particles.
2) This project makes use of DE-10 Standard development kit from Altera.
3) Here,the acceleration between the bodies is done by the FPGA, and the partices' velocity and the position is updated by the HPS, and the simulation is displayed on the VGA monitor.
